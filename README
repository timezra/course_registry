This project demonstrates how to design a Grails 2.0 web application via a series of WebDriver-based Spock specifications that can be executed in multiple browsers on multiple OSes through Sauce Labs as long as you configure the Sauce Labs username and apiKey. 

It is the companion source code for this tutorial: http://timezra.blogspot.com/2012/1/bdd-with-spock-and-selenium.html
